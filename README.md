## Let's take the stress out of doctor's visits and make the most of your medical care.

**Authors**: *Tyler Gustafson (Gustani), Averine Sanduku, Ramakrishna Ramadurgam, Karina Kowarsch* **| Date:** *Winter 2025*

Patients often struggle to consistently and accurately share relevant health information with their doctors, especially when symptoms arise unexpectedly. This can be for numerous reasons from appointments being so far away to recency bias of focusing on more recent symptoms first vs more important ones a month ago or for countless other reasons. This can affect all sorts of patients such as the typical patient annual check-up to **chronic illness care**, **caregivers and families**, and **post-operative monitoring**.

**VitalStory addresses a significant problem where inadequate communication leads to inequitable outcomes for patients, especially those who struggle to articulate their medical histories.**
